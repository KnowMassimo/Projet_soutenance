# Projet_'Leftover Food Recipe Generator'

Context:
Fight against food waste, spending less and even saving, it's possible! Creativity is the best weapon against food waste. Yes, but are you running out of ideas?
Thanks to the power of artificial intelligence, meal planning with leftovers has never been easier.

Project:
- We'll create a basic, but handy tool that leverages AI to generate recipes suggestions based on your leftovers ingredients.
- We'll create a Python application using streamlit.
- The app will incorporate features from the langchain library, which integrates OpenAI's language model capabilities, allowing us to generate text based on prompts.
- We will display a few meal options, based on the list of leftovers ingredients. 
- We'll also use Sequential Chain objects in langchain to transform the model's text output into have a complementary tips on meal storage of food leftovers.

Synthesis //
we will:
-use OpenAI language-models with the langchain library./
-create PromptTemplate objects in langchain./
-use LLMChain objects and SequentialChain objects to create sequences of chained calls to language models./
-tie the above into a Streamlit UI./
